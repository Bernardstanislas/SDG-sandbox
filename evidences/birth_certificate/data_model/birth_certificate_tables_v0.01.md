|     given name          |     string        |     The foaf:givenName property fully   represents the Person Core Vocabulary term of given name.                                                                           |     A given name, or multiple given names, are   the denominator(s) that identify an individual within a family. These are   given to a person by his or her parents at birth or may be legally recognised   as 'given names' through a formal process. All given names are ordered in one   field so that, for example, the given name for Johan Sebastian Bach is “Johan   Sebastian”.                                                               |     [1..1]          |
|     family name         |     string        |     The foaf:familyName property fully   represents the Person Core Vocabulary term of family name.                                                                         |     A family name is usually shared by members   of a family. This attribute also carries prefixes or suffixes which are part   of the Family Name, e.g. “de Boer”, “van de Putte”, “von und zu Orlow”.   Multiple family names, such as are commonly found in Hispanic countries, are   recorded in the single Family Name field so that, for example, Miguel de   Cervantes Saavedra's Family Name would be recorded as "de Cervantes   Saavedra.    |     [1..1]          |
|     birth   date        |     date          |     The schema:birthDate property fully   represents the Person Core Vocabulary term of date of birth.                                                                      |     A date that specifies the birth date of a   person. The date should be provided as a literal and data typed if   applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |     [1..1]          |
|     gender              |     code          |     The foaf:gender property relates a Agent   (typically a Person) to a string representing its gender. In most cases the   value will be the string 'female' or 'male'    |     The gender of an individual should   be recorded using a controlled vocabulary that is appropriate for the   specific context. In some cases, the chromosomal or physical state of an   individual will be more important than the gender that they express, in   others the reverse will be true. What is always important is that the   controlled vocabulary used to describe an individual's gender is stated   explicitly                     |     [1..1]          |
|     citizenship         |     code          |     The range of citizenship is   dcterms:Jurisdiction.                                                                                                                     |     The citizenship relationship links a Person   to a Jurisdiction that has conferred citizenship rights on the individual   such as the right to vote, to receive certain protection from the community   or the issuance of a passport. Multiple citizenships are recorded as multiple   instances of the citizenship relationship.                                                                                                                 |     [1..1]          |

|     pref label    |     string         |     preferred label    |     As defined in the ORG Ontology, a   preferred label is used to provide the primary, legally recognised name of   the organization. An organization may only have one such name in any given   language. Primary names may be provided in multiple languages with multiple   instances of the preferred label property.                                                                          |     [1..1]         |
|     identifier    |     Other class    |     identifier         |     Many organizations are referred to by an   acronym or some other identifier. For example, among the EU institutions, the   ECB is the identifier for the European Central Bank, OLAF for the European   Anti-Fraud Office, and so on. These are formally recognised by the European   Commission which provides a list of such acronyms. Analogous lists should be   used in other contexts.    |     [1..1]         |

|     postName       |     string      |     The key postal division of the   address, usually the city. (INSPIRE's definition is "One or more names   created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of   addresses and postal delivery points."). The domain of locn:postName is   locn:Address.    |     TBD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |     [1..1]         |
|     adminUnitL1    |     string      |     The uppermost administrative unit   for the address, almost always a country. The domain of locn:adminUnitL1 is   locn:Address and the range is a literal, conceptually defined by the INSPIRE   Geographical Name data type.                                                  |     Best practice is to use the ISO 3166-1 code but if this   is inappropriate for the context, country names should be provided in a   consistent manner to reduce ambiguity. For example, either write 'United   Kingdom' or 'UK' consistently throughout the data set and avoid mixing the   two.    |     [1..1]         |
