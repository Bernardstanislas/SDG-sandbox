Welcome to the GiHub repository of Work Package 4 - Data Semantics, Formats & Quality

## Data Semantics, Formats & Quality
Work Package 4 - Data Semantics, Formats and Quality (WP4) will build on the initial work carried out as part of the 2017.05 Interoperability requirements for the Single Digital Gateway action. This action provided the technical basis for the implementation of the future Regulation by detailing the IT architecture of the Single Digital Gateway and by identifying functional, technical and semantic interoperability challenges for the development of the IT tools and their interconnection with EU Member States IT tools and EU level tools[[1]](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/actions/common-architecture-single-digital-gateway_en).

WP4, which must assure continuity towards the implementation of the SDG regulation has a twofold objective :

* For a selected set of evidences, the WP will develop a set of common data models following an incremental or phased approach that best serves the interests of the SDG regulation and the Member States (MS); and
* Relying on the first objective – and in parallel – the WP will develop and test a methodology for defining further common data models, formats and quality for the exchange of evidence between the Member States.

The work done [[2]](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2015-03/Process%20and%20methodology%20for%20developing%20semantic%20agreements.pdf) in the past years under the ISA² programme and its action SEMIC will serve as a solid base to build a methodology, based on best practices and testing this methodology to certain types of evidence with a working group composed of Member States representatives. Furthermore, the methodology will be refined in the development of the data models as part of the first objective of this WP.
